During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing s mother Julius wife was Ethel Sara n e Stoney 1881 1976 daughter of Edward Waller Stoney chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.Phil Maguire An Irishman s Diary page 5. The Irish Times 23 June 2012. Julius work with the ICS brought the family to British India where his grandfather had been a general in the Bengal Army. However both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain so they moved to Maida Vale ref name englishheritaget London where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912 as recorded by a blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth http blogs.nature.com london 2011 03 16 the scientific tourist in london 17 alan turings birth place The Scientific Tourist In London 17 Alan Turing s Birth Place Nature. London Blog later the Colonnade Hotel. ref name Hodges1983P5 ref name turingorguk He had an elder brother John the father of Sir John Dermot Turing 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets . Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. Copeland The Essential Turing http www.maths.ed.ac.uk aar turingletter.pdf pp. 336 337 . More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer. Springer In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest. In 2012 Sheth et al. found that in mice removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an increase in the overall size of the limb suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing type mechanism.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.

More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer.

A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

It is widely considered to be the computing world s highest honour equivalent to the Nobel Prize. On 23 June 1998 on what would have been Turing s 86th birthday his biographer Andrew Hodges unveiled an official English Heritage blue plaque at his birthplace and childhood home in Warrington Crescent London later the Colonnade Hotel.

A statue of Turing was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in Sackville Park between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and Canal Street. The memorial statue depicts the father of computer science sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text Alan Mathison Turing 1912 1954 and the motto Founder of Computer Science as it could appear if encoded by an Enigma machine IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ . A plaque at the statue s feet reads Father of computer science mathematician logician wartime codebreaker victim of prejudice . There is also a Bertrand Russell quotation Mathematics rightly viewed possesses not only truth but supreme beauty nbsp a beauty cold and austere like that of sculpture. The sculptor buried his own old Amstrad computer under the plinth as a tribute to the godfather of all modern computers . ref name computerburied In 1999 Time magazine Time magazine named Turing as one of the and stated The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard opening a spreadsheet or a word processing program is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine. ref name AFP In 2002 Turing was ranked twenty first on the BBC s poll of the 100 Greatest Britons following a UK wide vote. In 2006 British writer and mathematician Ioan James chose Turing as one of twenty people to feature in his book about famous historical figures who may have had some of the traits of Asperger syndrome. In 2010 actor playwright Jade Esteban Estrada portrayed Turing in the solo musical ICONS The Lesbian and Gay History of the World Vol. 4. In 2011 in The Guardian s My hero series writer Alan Garner chose Turing as his hero and described how they had met whilst out jogging in the early 1950s. Garner remembered Turing as funny and witty and said that he talked endlessly . In 2006 Alan Turing was named with online resources as an LGBT History Month Icon. In 2006 Boston Pride named Turing their Honorary Grand Marshal. ref name bostonpride Manchester The logo of Apple Inc. is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to Alan Turing with the bite mark a reference to his death. Both the designer of the logo and the company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the design.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. Copeland The Essential Turing http www.maths.ed.ac.uk aar turingletter.pdf pp. 336 337 . More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer. Springer In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed. On 26 July 2012 a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952. Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse Lady Trumpington who worked for Turing during the war and Lord Sharkey the bill s sponsor called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request.Pearse Damian https www.theguardian.com science 2012 dec 14 alan turing pardon stephen hawking Alan Turing should be pardoned argue Stephen Hawking and top scientists The Guardian 13 December 2012.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. Copeland The Essential Turing http www.maths.ed.ac.uk aar turingletter.pdf pp. 336 337 . More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer. Springer In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

The TCAC chaired by S. Barry Cooper with Alan Turing s nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and Bletchley Park. On 23 June 2012 Google featured an interactive doodle where visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine so when run the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence featuring Google in Baudot Murray code. The Bletchley Park Trust collaborated with Winning Moves to publish an Alan Turing edition of the board game Monopoly. The game s squares and cards have been revised to tell the story of Alan Turing s life from his birthplace in Maida Vale to Hut 8 at Bletchley Park. The game also includes a replica of an original hand drawn board created by William Newman son of Turing s mentor Max Newman which Turing played on in the 1950s. In the Philippines the Department of Philosophy at De La Salle University Manila hosted Turing 2012 an international conference on philosophy artificial intelligence and cognitive science from 27 to 28 March 2012 to commemorate the centenary birth of Turing. Madurai India held celebrations with a programme attended by 6 000 students. UK celebrations Olympic Torch flame was passed on in front of Turing s statue in Manchester on his 100th birthday. There was a three day conference in Manchester in June a two day conference in San Francisco organised by the ACM and a birthday party and Turing Centenary Conference in Cambridge organised at King s College Cambridge and the University of Cambridge the latter organised by the association Computability in Europe. The Science Museum in London launched a free exhibition devoted to Turing s life and achievements in June 2012 to run until July 2013. In February 2012 the Royal Mail issued a stamp featuring Turing as part of its Britons of Distinction series. The London 2012 Olympic Torch flame was passed on in front of Turing s statue in Sackville Gardens Manchester on the evening of 23 June 2012 the 100th anniversary of his birth. On 22 June 2012 Manchester City Council in partnership with the Lesbian and Gay Foundation launched the Alan Turing Memorial Award which will recognise individuals or groups who have made a significant contribution to the fight against homophobia in Manchester. At the University of Oxford a new course in Computer Science and Philosophy was established to coincide with the centenary of Turing s birth. A new undergraduate degree course with its first students having started in 2012 the centenary of Alan Turing s birth. Previous events have included a celebration of Turing s life and achievements at the University of Manchester arranged by the British Logic Colloquium and the British Society for the History of Mathematics on 5 June 2004. Portrayal in adaptations Theatre portrayed Turing in the 2014 film The Imitation Game Breaking the Code is a 1986 play by Hugh Whitemore about Alan Turing. The play ran in London s West End beginning in November 1986 and on Broadway from 15 November 1987 to 10 April 1988. There was also a 1996 BBC television production broadcast in the United States by PBS . In all three performances Turing was played by Derek Jacobi. The Broadway production was nominated for three Tony Awards including Best Actor in a Play Best Featured Actor in a Play and Best Direction of a Play and for two Drama Desk Awards for Best Actor and Best Featured Actor. Turing was again portrayed by Jacobi in the 1996 television film adaptation of Breaking the Code. ref name BBC mutlitiude In 2012 in honour of the Turing Centennial American Lyric Theater commissioned an operatic exploration of the life and death of Alan Turing from composer Justine F. Chen and librettist David Simpatico. Titled The Life and Death s of Alan Turing the opera is a historical fantasia on the life of Turing. The opera will receive a concert performance in October 2015 in New York City. In November 2014 the opera and several other artistic works inspired by Turing s life were featured on Studio 360. Literature In William Gibson s Neuromancer the Turing police have jurisdiction over AIs. 1984 Turing is featured in the Neal Stephenson novel Cryptonomicon 1999 . The 2006 novel A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines contrasts fictionalised accounts of the lives and ideas of Turing and Kurt G del.. The 2015 novel Speak written by Louisa Hall includes a series of fictional letters written from Turing to his best friend s mother throughout his life detailing his research about artificial intelligence. Music Electronic music duo Matmos released an EP titled For Alan Turing in 2006 which was based on material commissioned by Dr. Robert Osserman and David Elsenbud of the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute. In one of its tracks an original Enigma Machine is sampled. In 2012 Spanish group Hidrogenesse dedicated their LP Un d gito binario dudoso. Recital para Alan Turing A dubious binary digit. Concert for Alan Turing to the memory of the mathematician. A musical work inspired by Turing s life written by Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of the Pet Shop Boys entitled A Man from the Future was announced in late 2013. It was performed by the Pet Shop Boys and Juliet Stevenson narrator the BBC Singers and the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Dominic Wheeler at the BBC Proms in the Royal Albert Hall on 23 July 2014. Codebreaker is also the title of a choral work by the composer James McCarthy. It includes settings of texts by the poets Wilfred Owen Sara Teasdale Walt Whitman Oscar Wilde and Robert Burns that are used to illustrate aspects of Turing s life. It was premiered on 26 April 2014 at the Barbican Centre in London where it was performed by the Hertfordshire Chorus who commissioned the work led by David Temple with the soprano soloist Naomi Harvey providing the voice of Turing s mother. Film The historical drama film The Imitation Game directed by Morten Tyldum and starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing and Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke was released in the UK on 14 November 2014 and released theatrically in the US on 28 November 2014.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. Copeland The Essential Turing http www.maths.ed.ac.uk aar turingletter.pdf pp. 336 337 . More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order.

He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer. Springer In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. Copeland The Essential Turing http www.maths.ed.ac.uk aar turingletter.pdf pp. 336 337 . More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer. Springer In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing s mother Julius wife was Ethel Sara n e Stoney 1881 1976 daughter of Edward Waller Stoney chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant Anglo Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County Longford while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in County Clare.Phil Maguire An Irishman s Diary page 5.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. Copeland The Essential Turing http www.maths.ed.ac.uk aar turingletter.pdf pp. 336 337 . More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer. Springer In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work and in such things as astronomy to which he introduced me as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me nbsp ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive because that is what he would like me to do. blockquote Some have speculated that Morcom s death was the cause of Turing s atheism and materialism.Paul Gray http www.time.com time magazine article 0 9171 990624 00.html Alan Turing Time Magazine s Most Important People of the Century p.2 Apparently at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter also written to Morcom s mother Turing said blockquote Personally I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body nbsp ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body can hold on to a spirit whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies the mechanism of the body holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later perhaps immediately. blockquote University and work on computability After Sherborne Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at King s College Cambridge where he gained first class honours in mathematics. In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.

More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer.

A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

During the Second World War Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher School GC CS at Bletchley Park Britain s codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8 the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers including improvements to the pre war Polish bombe method an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements including the Battle of the Atlantic and in so doing helped win the war. ref name bbc copeland A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both The Churchill Centre and Turing s biographer Andrew Hodges have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill Myths see and A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it. See Counterfactual history is difficult with respect to the effect Ultra intelligence had on the length of the war See for examaple and but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives. ref name bbc copeland After the war he worked at the National Physical Laboratory where he designed the ACE among the first designs for a stored program computer. In 1948 Turing joined Max Newman s Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction first observed in the 1960s. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts when by the Labouchere Amendment gross indecency was still criminal in the UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment with DES as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954 16 days before his 42nd birthday from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as suicide but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009 following an Internet campaign British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for the appalling way he was treated. Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingpardon24dec2013 ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for a 2017 law in the United Kingdom that retroactively pardons men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. ref name BBC pardon Early life Turing was born in Maida Vale London while his father Julius Mathison Turing 1873 1947 was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil Service ICS at Chhatrapur Bihar and Orissa Province in British India. ref name Hodges1983P5 Turing s father was the son of a clergyman the Rev. nbsp John Robert Turing from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the Netherlands and included a baronet.

Turing s father s civil service commission was still active and during Turing s childhood years Turing s parents travelled between Hastings in England and India leaving their two sons to stay with a retired Army couple. At Hastings Turing stayed at Baston Lodge Upper Maze Hill St Leonards on Sea now marked with a blue plaque. Very early in life Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently. ref name toolbox His parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927 and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque. Education School Turing s parents enrolled him at St Michael s a day school at 20 Charles Road St Leonards on Sea at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on as did many of his subsequent educators. From January 1922 to 1926 Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School an independent school in the village of Frant in Sussex now East Sussex . In 1926 at the age of 13 he went on to Sherborne School an independent school in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike in Britain but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied from Southampton to Sherborne stopping overnight at an inn. ref name metamagical Turing s natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist he is wasting his time at a public school . Despite this Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary calculus. In 1928 aged 16 Turing encountered Albert Einstein s work not only did he grasp it but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein s questioning of Newton s laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit. Christopher Morcom At Sherborne Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom who has been described as Turing s first love . Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing s future endeavours but it was cut short by Morcom s death in February 1930 from complications of bovine tuberculosis contracted after drinking infected cow s milk some years previously. ref name NYReviewBooks Rachel Hassall http oldshirburnian.org.uk wp content uploads 2014 03 The Sherborne Formula Vivat 2012 2013 optimised.pdf The Sherborne Formula The Making of Alan Turing Vivat 2012 13 ref name teuscher The event caused Turing great sorrow.

In 1935 at the age of 22 he was elected a fellow of King s on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.See Section 3 of John Aldrich England and Continental Probability in the Inter War Years Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique vol. 5 2 http www.jehps.net decembre2009.html Decembre 2009 Journal Electronique d Histoire des Probabilit s et de la Statistique Unknown to the committee the theorem had already been proven in 1922 by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. In 1936 Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem 1936 . In this paper Turing reformulated Kurt G del s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation replacing G del s universal arithmetic based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. Entscheidungsproblem decision problem was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his universal computing machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him. Although Turing s proof was published shortly after Alonzo Church s equivalent proof using his lambda calculus Turing s approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church s. It also included a notion of a Universal Machine now known as a universal Turing machine with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine as indeed could Church s lambda calculus . According to the Church Turing thesis Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing s paper. von Neumann nbsp ... firmly emphasised to me and to others I am sure that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing insofar as not anticipated by Babbage Lovelace and others. Letter by Stanley Frankel to Brian Randell 1972 quoted in Jack Copeland 2004 The Essential Turing p22. To this day Turing machines are a central object of study in theory of computation. From September 1936 to July 1938 Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton University. In addition to his purely mathematical work he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro mechanical binary multiplier. In June 1938 he obtained his PhD from Princeton Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

John von Neumann wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant but he went back to England.John Von Neumann The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer Game Theory Nuclear Deterrence and Much More Norman MacRae 1999 American Mathematical Society Chapter 8 When Turing returned to Cambridge he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics. Remarkably the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim including interjections from Turing and other students from students notes.Cora Diamond ed. Wittgenstein s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics University of Chicago Press 1976 Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them. Cryptanalysis During the Second World War Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said You needed exceptional talent you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing s was that genius. From September 1938 Turing had been working part time with the GC CS the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma with Dilly Knox a senior GC CS codebreaker.Copeland Jack Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age p. 352 in Action This Day 2001. Soon after the July 1939 Warsaw meeting at which the Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of Enigma rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma code messages Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem. The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator procedure that the Germans were likely to change which they did in May 1940. Turing s approach was more general using crib based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the bombe an improvement of the Polish Bomba . . Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940 before moving to Hut 8. On 4 September 1939 the day after the UK declared war on Germany Turing reported to Bletchley Park the wartime station of GC CS. ref name Copeland2006p378 Copeland 2006 p. 378. Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed Banburismus developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40 42 Tunny dubbed Turingery and towards the end of the war the development of a portable secure voice scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah. By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches titled The Applications of Probability to Cryptography and Paper on Statistics of Repetitions which were of such value to GC CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released to the UK National Archives until April 2012 shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician who identified himself only as Richard said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance and their relevance to post war cryptanalysis ref name bbcrichard Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as Prof and his treatise on Enigma was known as The Prof s Book . Jack Good a cryptanalyst who worked with him is quoted by Ronald Lewin as having said of Turing While working at Bletchley Turing who was a talented long distance runner occasionally ran the to London when he was needed for high level meetings and he was capable of world class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team hampered by an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club s best runner a fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone. In 1946 Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services but his work remained secret for many years.https www.thegazette.co.uk all notices content 114 Bombe Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park ref name Copeland2006p378 Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba cryptography bomba kryptologiczna from which its name was derived. The bombe with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon Welchman became one of the primary tools and the major automated one used to attack Enigma enciphered messages. Jack Good opined at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message i.e. rotor order rotor settings and plugboard settings using a suitable crib cryptanalysis crib a fragment of probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors which had on the order of 10 sup 19 sup states or 10 sup 22 sup states for the four rotor U boat variant Professor Jack Good in The Men Who Cracked Enigma 2003 with his caveat if my memory is correct . the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib implemented electromechanically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter this simply wasn t possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940. By late 1941 Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman Hugh Alexander and Stuart Milner Barry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100 000 tons a month but they were still on a knife edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally breaking all the rules on 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces. As Andrew Hodges biographer of Turing later wrote This letter had an electric effect. ref name Hodges 1983 221 Churchill wrote a memo to General Ismay which read ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done. On 18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken. ref name Hodges 1983 221 The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister s response but as Milner Barry later recalled All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth. Copeland The Essential Turing http www.maths.ed.ac.uk aar turingletter.pdf pp. 336 337 . More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war. ref name codebreaker at Bletchley Park commissioned by Sidney Frank built from half a million pieces of Welsh slate. Hut 8 and the naval Enigma Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of German naval Enigma because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself . ref name MahonP14 In December 1939 Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services. ref name MahonP14 That same night he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus a sequential statistical technique what Abraham Wald later called sequential analysis to assist in breaking the naval Enigma though I was not sure that it would work in practice and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken. ref name MahonP14 For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the Ban unit ban . Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes. In 1941 Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst but their engagement was short lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fianc e who was reportedly unfazed by the revelation Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage. Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington he also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton Ohio. Turing s reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic quote text The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way. Their test of commutators can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it. cite journal last Turing first Alan M. date 2001 title VISIT TO NATIONAL CASH REGISTER CORPORATION OF DAYTON OHIO url http dx.doi.org 10.1080 0161 110191889734 journal Cryptologia publisher Taylor Francis volume 25 issue 1 pages 1 10 doi 10.1080 0161 110191889734 access date 4 June 2010 source During this trip he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices. He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence Hugh Alexander had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8 although Alexander had been de facto head for some time Turing having little interest in the day to day running of the section . Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park. Alexander wrote this about Turing s contribution Turingery In July 1942 Turing devised a technique termed Turingery or jokingly Turingismus for use against the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans new Geheimschreiber secret writer machine. This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of wheel breaking i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny s wheels. He also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who under the guidance of Max Newman went on to build the Colossus computer the world s first programmable digital electronic computer which replaced a simpler prior machine the Heath Robinson and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages. Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development. Delilah Following his work at Bell Labs in the US Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system and in the latter part of the war he moved to work for the Secret Service s Radio Security Service later HMGCC at Hanslope Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah. It was intended for different applications lacking capability for use with long distance radio transmissions and in any case Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a Winston Churchill speech Delilah was not adopted for use. Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war. Early computers and the Turing test From 1945 to 1947 Turing lived in Hampton London while he worked on the design of the ACE Automatic Computing Engine at the National Physical Laboratory NPL . He presented a paper on 19 February 1946 which was the first detailed design of a stored program computer. Von Neumann s incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing s paper but it was much less detailed and according to John R. Womersley Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division it contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing s own . citing Although ACE was a feasible design the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.See While he was at Cambridge the Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950 and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it including the English Electric DEUCE and the American Bendix G 15. The full version of Turing s ACE was not built until after his death. According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute for Physics published by Genscher D sseldorf there was a meeting between Alan Turing and Konrad Zuse. It took place in G ttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were Womersley Turing Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse Walther and Billing. For more details see Herbert Bruderer Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz . In 1948 Turing was appointed Reader in the Mathematics Department at the Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949 he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there working on software for one of the earliest stored program computers the Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 Cite journal last1 Turing first1 A.

The idea was that a computer could be said to think if a human interrogator could not tell it apart through conversation from a human being.Harnad Stevan 2008 http eprints.soton.ac.uk 262954 The Annotation Game On Turing 1950 on Computing Machinery and Intelligence . In Epstein Robert Peters Grace Eds. Parsing the Turing Test Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer. Springer In the paper Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child s mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet the CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer. In 1948 Turing working with his former undergraduate colleague D. G. Champernowne began writing a chess program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950 the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp. In 1952 he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1 but lacking enough power the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded. http www.chessgames.com perl chessgame gid 1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie 1952 Turing Test Chessgames.com The program lost to Turing s colleague Alick Glennie although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne s wife. His Turing test was a significant characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence which continues after more than half a century. He also invented the LU decomposition method in 1948 ref name doi10.1093 qjmam 1.1.287 used today for solving matrix equations. Pattern formation and mathematical biology In 1951 when Turing was 39 years old he turned to mathematical biology finally publishing his masterpiece The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis in January 1952. He was interested in morphogenesis the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. Among other things he wanted to understand Fibonacci phyllotaxis the existence of Fibonacci numbers in plant structures. He suggested that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space termed a reaction diffusion system could account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis . He used systems of partial differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A then we say that the reaction is autocatalytic and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. In order to calculate the extent of this Turing would have needed a powerful computer but these were not so freely available in 1951 so he had to use linear approximations in order to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results and produced for example a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris Belousov had performed experiments with similar results but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. For a modern view of living organisms and the second law see The Second Law of Thermodynamics Section 7. Unfortunately Belousov was not aware of Turing s paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.John Gribbin Deep Simplicity p.126 Random House 2004 Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood Turing s work on morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical biology. One of the early applications of Turing s paper was the work by James Murray explaining spots and stripes on the fur of cats large and small.James Murray How the leopard gets its spots Scientific American vol 258 number 3 p.80 March 1988James Murray Mathematical Biology I 2007 Chapter 6 Springer VerlagJohn Gibbin Deep Simplicity p.134 Random House 2004 Further research in the area suggests that Turing s work can partially explain the growth of feathers hair follicles the branching pattern of lungs and even the left right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest.

Conviction for indecency In January 1952 Turing then 39 started a relationship with Arnold Murray a 19 year old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester s Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing s house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. ref name LeavittP268 Initial committal proceedings for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing s solicitor reserved his defence i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations. Later convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor Turing entered a plea of guilty. The case Elizabeth II Regina v. Turing and Murray was brought to trial on 31 March 1952. Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol now known as diethylstilbestrol or DES a synthetic oestrogen this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia fulfilling in the literal sense Turing s prediction that no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man but quite who I ve not found out . Murray was given a conditional discharge. Turing s conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC CS in 1946 though he kept his academic job . He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952 but was free to visit other European countries. Turing was never accused of espionage but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park he was prevented by the Official Secrets Act from discussing his war work. Death On 8 June 1954 Turing s housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered an apple lay half eaten beside his bed and although the apple was not tested for cyanide it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954. Turing s ashes were scattered there just as his father s had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer David Leavitt have both suggested that Turing was re enacting a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs 1937 his favourite fairy tale both noting that in Leavitt s words he took an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew. and Alternative death theories Philosophy professor Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of the coroner s historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing s death this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for electroplating gold onto spoons which uses potassium cyanide to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half eaten. ref name Copeland Cite news first Roland last Pease title Alan Turing Inquest s suicide verdict not supportable url http www.bbc.co.uk news science environment 18561092 publisher BBC News date 23 June 2012 accessdate 23 June 2012 quote We have nbsp ... been recreating the narrative of Turing s life and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide.

Government apology and pardon In August 2009 John Graham Cumming started a petition urging the British Government to apologise for Turing s prosecution as a homosexual. The petition received more than 30 000 signatures. ref name PMapology The petition was only open to UK citizens. Prime Minister Gordon Brown acknowledged the petition releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as appalling ref name PMapology ref name PM apology John Leech the MP for Manchester Withington 2005 15 was the first MP to formally submit a bill to pardon Turing. Leech said it was ultimately just embarrassing that the conviction still stood. In December 2011 William Jones created an e petition ref name PardonPetition requesting the British Government pardon Turing for his conviction of gross indecency ref name BBBCPardon The petition gathered over 37 000 signatures ref name turingindependent24dec2013 ref name PardonPetition but the request was discouraged by Lord McNally who gave the following opinion in his role as the Justice Minister ref name PardonPetitionDiscouraged John Leech the MP for Manchester Withington 2005 15 submitted several bills to Parliament and campaigned with William Jones to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of Commons that Turing s contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was ultimately just embarrassing that the conviction still stood. Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was passed. On 26 July 2012 a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 of which he was convicted on 31 March 1952. Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph the physicist Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees President of the Royal Society Sir Paul Nurse Lady Trumpington who worked for Turing during the war and Lord Sharkey the bill s sponsor called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request.Pearse Damian https www.theguardian.com science 2012 dec 14 alan turing pardon stephen hawking Alan Turing should be pardoned argue Stephen Hawking and top scientists The Guardian 13 December 2012.

On 24 December 2013 Queen Elizabeth II signed a pardon ref name turingpardon24dec2013 for Turing s conviction for gross indecency with immediate effect. Announcing the pardon Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be remembered and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and not for his later criminal conviction. ref name BBC pardon24Dec ref name turingindependent24dec2013 The Queen officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014. The Queen s action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.Pardoned Alan Turing Computing patriarch. Time Magazine vol. 183 no. 1 13 January 2014 p. 14. Retrieved 6 January 2014. This case is unusual in that pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically innocent and a request has been made by the family or other interested party. Neither condition was met in regard to Turing s conviction. ref name grauniad In a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron after announcement of the pardon human rights advocate Peter Tatchell criticised the decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements when thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received pardons. ref name UKHP Tatchell also called for a new investigation into Turing s death In September 2016 the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences in what was described as an Alan Turing law . The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom contained in the Policing and Crime Act 2017 which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The law applies in England and Wales. Centenary celebrations on stage for an Alan Turing Year conference at De La Salle University Manila 27 March 2012 To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing s birth the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee TCAC co ordinated the Alan Turing Year a year long programme of events around the world honouring Turing s life and achievements. The TCAC chaired by S. Barry Cooper with Alan Turing s nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and Bletchley Park. On 23 June 2012 Google featured an interactive doodle where visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine so when run the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence featuring Google in Baudot Murray code. The Bletchley Park Trust collaborated with Winning Moves to publish an Alan Turing edition of the board game Monopoly. The game s squares and cards have been revised to tell the story of Alan Turing s life from his birthplace in Maida Vale to Hut 8 at Bletchley Park. The game also includes a replica of an original hand drawn board created by William Newman son of Turing s mentor Max Newman which Turing played on in the 1950s. In the Philippines the Department of Philosophy at De La Salle University Manila hosted Turing 2012 an international conference on philosophy artificial intelligence and cognitive science from 27 to 28 March 2012 to commemorate the centenary birth of Turing. Madurai India held celebrations with a programme attended by 6 000 students. UK celebrations Olympic Torch flame was passed on in front of Turing s statue in Manchester on his 100th birthday. There was a three day conference in Manchester in June a two day conference in San Francisco organised by the ACM and a birthday party and Turing Centenary Conference in Cambridge organised at King s College Cambridge and the University of Cambridge the latter organised by the association Computability in Europe. The Science Museum in London launched a free exhibition devoted to Turing s life and achievements in June 2012 to run until July 2013.
